# Parkinson's Disease Detection

This project employs machine learning techniques to detect Parkinson's disease using relevant datasets. The analysis and model development are documented in the Jupyter Notebook `Parkinson_Disease_Detection.ipynb`.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and identifying key features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing classification algorithms to detect Parkinson's disease.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
